## Development Setup

This project is designed primarily to run **inside Snowflake** via:

- Snowflake Notebooks (Snowpark Python)
- SQL Worksheets for running the scripts in `sql/`

You can still:

- Edit the code locally
- Version it with Git
- Sync changes back to Snowflake

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-improvement`
3. Commit your changes with clear messages
4. Open a Pull Request with:
   - Summary of the change
   - Screenshots or logs if relevant
   - Any Snowflake version / feature requirements

## Code Style

- Keep Python code clean and documented
- Prefer explicit SQL over overly clever abstractions
- Add comments where behavior might not be obvious
