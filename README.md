# AI Governance Autopilot in Snowflake

An end-to-end demo of an **AI-powered governance “autopilot”** built entirely inside Snowflake.

This system:
- Auto-tags columns with sensitivity labels (PII, CONFIDENTIAL, INTERNAL, PUBLIC)
- Auto-applies row access policies
- Sends alerts for untagged tables
- Logs all governance actions

See full instructions in the Medium article.
